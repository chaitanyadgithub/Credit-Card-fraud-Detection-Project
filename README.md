Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset requires preprocessing and normalization to handle the intricacies of financial transactions, including addressing class imbalance issues. The approach involves splitting the data into training and testing sets, training classification algorithms such as logistic regression or random forests, and evaluating model performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, techniques like oversampling or undersampling are applied to enhance model accuracy. Dive into this project to tackle real-world data challenges and build a robust fraud detection system.
